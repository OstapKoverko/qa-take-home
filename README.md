## Assignment

At it’s core, Maestro is a project-management web application built using Ruby-on-Rails to support the backend service, and a ReactJS frontend application.

You are tasked with creating a minimal e2e testing solution for the web application at <https://public.test-go-maestro.com>.
The testing solution should attempt to test basic CRUD functionality for Objectives of a Company (`https://public.dev-go-maestro.com/#{company_id}/objectives`) in the UI.

## Instructions

Your assignment is to:

1. write a test plan for our web application
2. additionally, write automated e2e tests that execute on the test plan using any tools/frameworks that you prefer.

## Submission Notes

We expect this assignment to take between 4 and 6 hours.
